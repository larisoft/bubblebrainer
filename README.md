I wrote this game to help me exercise my memory every morning. 

The game, (Bubblebrainer) is a game implemented in C#. Its properly commented and highly recommended for programmers who want to get into game development. I believe you will find the code easy to follow, and the seperation of concerns in the game is something i belive will help new programmers appreciate the necessity of proper design in programs.

To babas in the house, the game dey good for for memory o. Try am out too o!
